    <h1> OUR MISSION </h1> 
    <!-- Explains the problem we are tying to solve-->
    <p> We want to provide everyone with access to clean water. These countries do not have the resources to provide clean water to everybody living in the country. People living in water-stressed countries:The Middle East, North Africa, or fast growing densely populated places, especially struggle with this issue. Through Refresh we aim to solve this issue.  </p>
